Electr is a PaaS that seeks to bridge the divide between politicians and their constitutes. 
Now more than ever it seems that politicians are catering to the elites and disregarding the voice of the people. 
Sadly this is actually the most pragmatic solution in our current society. 
Electr seeks to remedy this imbalance and campaign for the people. 

With Ectr, we set out to fix a problem that is crippling American Democracy. In America, money
is power, currently only the rich can voice their opinions because they have the money and the
network to do so. Ectr seeks to restructure the way politicians think. When the people are given
the ability to voice their opinion with our network and make contributions with our integrated
payment system, amazing things can happen. Finally, the truest form of representative
government can be implemented.
